# Nathanaels Dotfiles

This dotfiles are only tested with Ubuntu Linux 20.10 and may also require tools that are not installed by this Repo. Usage by your own risk.

## Principal

i only try to save files that contain content i configured for my use. NO content that could otherwise by installed or loaded for example binaries, repos, scripts.

### ZSH Usage

No Oh-my-zsh is used but zplug. oh-my-zsh is in some cases sourced where i found the scripts usefull
