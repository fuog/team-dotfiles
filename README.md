# Nathanaels Dotfiles

This dotfiles are only tested with Ubuntu Linux 20.10 and may also require tools that are not installed by this Repo. Usage by your own risk.

## install

```bash
$SHELL <(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuog/dotfiles/master/install.zsh")
```

## Principal

i only try to save files that contain content i configured for my use. NO content that could otherwise by installed or loaded for example binaries, repos, scripts.

### ZSH Usage

- No Oh-my-zsh is used but zplug.
- Oh-my-zsh stuff is in some cases sourced where i found the scripts usefull
- every external dependency sould be checked and skiped if not found
